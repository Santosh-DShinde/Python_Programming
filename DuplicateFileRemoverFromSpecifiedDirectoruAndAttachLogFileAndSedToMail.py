"""Design automation script which performs following task.-----
1)  ‚úî Accept Directory name from user and delete all duplicate files from the specified directory by considering the checksum of files.
2)  ‚úî Create one Directory and inside that directory create log file which maintains all names of duplicate files which are deleted.
3)  ‚úî Name of that log file should contains the date and time at which that file gets created.
4)  ‚úî Accept duration in minutes from user and perform task of duplicate file removal after the specific time interval.
5)  ‚úî Accept Mail id from user and send the attachment of the log file.
Mail body should contains below things :---------------
6)  ‚úî Starting time of scanning
7)  ‚úî Total number of files scanned
8)  ‚úî Total number of duplicate files found
       Note :-------
9)  ‚úî For every separate task write separate function.
10) ‚úî Write all user defined functions in one user defined module.
11) ‚úî Use proper validation techniques.
12) ‚úî Provide Help and usage option for script.
13) ‚úî Mail body should contains statistics about the operation of duplicate file removal.
